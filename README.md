# Networking-Quizz
Quizz-game UI implementing network programming
Crux Round 2 Task: Networking in C++
Network Programming involves writing programs that communicate with other programs across a network. 

The project is aimed at implementing this concept through a Quiz-Game UI program that communicates with another server program.
Leaderboards are stored on and maintained by a server.
Post game stats such as score, accuracy, speed, etc are some of the attributes of the leaderboards, which are updated after every game.
