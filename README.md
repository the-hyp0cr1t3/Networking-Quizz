# Networking-Quizz
Quizz-game UI implementing network programming
Crux Round 2 Task: Networking in C++
Network Programming involves writing programs that communicate with other programs across a network. 

The project is aimed at implementing this concept through a Quiz-Game UI program that communicates with another server program.
Leaderboards are stored on and maintained by a server.
Post game stats such as score, accuracy, speed, etc are some of the attributes of the leaderboards, which are updated after every game.

Note: This was done in a Windows environment and may not work on different environments

Make sure the following has been done before running:
-value stored in PATH macro in mymacros.h should be changed appropriately
-create 3 folders within the path and change QBANK, DATA, DUMP macros in mymacros.h to whatever you have named them
-store a text file inside QBANK (or whatever you've called the subfolder) in the same format as CHEM2.txt as shown
